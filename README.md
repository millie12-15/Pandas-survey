# Pandas-survey
a. Select a subset of rows in the surveys_df DataFrame that contain data from the year 1999 and that contain weight values less than or equal to 8. How many rows did you end up with? Now save this as a new data frame and write it to a csv file (show me the code to do this not the new file)      b. You can use the isin command in Python to query a DataFrame based upon a list of values as follows:        surveys_df[surveys_df['species_id'].isin([listGoesHere])]       Use the isin function to find all plots that contain these  species: NL DM PF PE DS.  How many records contain these values? and how many plots?
